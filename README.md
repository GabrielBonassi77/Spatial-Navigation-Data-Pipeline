# Welcome to the Spatial Navigation Data Pipeline

This data pipeline allows users to extract useful motion data from videos in a straightforward manner. In regards to it's application in neuroscience, the velocity threshold algorithm utilized by the data pipeline can calculate the velocity of individual body parts between frames and automatically remove data points that exceed a set velocity threshold. In theory, by removing neural data points that are more likely to be attributed to motion instead of the                         uthored by Gabriel Bonassi.was inspired by Dr. Roberto Vincis of Florida State Univeristy.

To get started please download Anaconda if not already installed.

Note: that this data pipeline is meant for analysis of motion data obtained from video via DeepLabCut (DLC). This repository will not explain how to use DLC, so visit https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut to download and learn how to use the library.


From the Anaconda Home Page, click on Jupyter Notebook. You must install it if using Anaconda for the first time.
