To get started please download Anaconda if not already installed   
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ 

  
Install DeepLabCut if not already installed. For GPU, open Anaconda and open a CMD.exe Prompt from the home screen. cd into the folder you wish to download and then input the following code.   
  
Note: if this does not work, you probably have to install Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
  
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git
```

Next, cd into the folder of the cloned repository (the folder you just downloaded) and then cd into \conda-environments

If you cloned the repo onto your Desktop, the command may look like:  
```cd C:\Users\YourUserName\Desktop\DeepLabCut\conda-environments```
