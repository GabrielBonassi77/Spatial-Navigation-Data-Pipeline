# Welcome to the Spatial Navigation Data Pipeline

This code is adapted from the works of Federico Claudi and Alexander Mathis. The velocity threshold algorithm was inspired by Dr. Roberto Vincis of Florida State Univeristy and authored by Gabriel Bonassi.

To get started please download Anaconda if not already installed.

Note: that this data pipeline is meant for analysis of motion data obtained from video via DeepLabCut (DLC). This repository will not explain how to use DLC, so visit https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut to download and learn how to use the library.


From the Anaconda Home Page, click on Jupyter Notebook. You must install it if using Anaconda for the first time.
